Experienced in research methodologies I know how to approach challenges systematically and with a creative mindset.\n\n\n\n\n\nI break out (of my expertise bubble)\nHaving experience in interdisciplinary projects, I like to push myself out of my comfort zone.

I simply believe that important decisions should never be made in a silo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI extend support\nThroughout my publishing journey, my focus has been on empowering researchers to amplify their work, disseminate knowledge, and break down publishing barriers at a scale. I strategically developed content for three scholarly journals and built numerous relationships with researchers worldwide, spanning from early-career to senior professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m upskilling\nPractice serves as my primary way of learning - a pathway to mastery. In my spare time, I dive into analytical projects, not only to broaden my skill set but also to refine my craft. I’m also enthusiastic about exploring a range of topics beyond data analysis, including parenting, productivity, and science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
