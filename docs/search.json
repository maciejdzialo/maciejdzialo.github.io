Yet, the majority of organisations struggle to capture real value from data and AI-driven innovations. Studies have shown that up to 95% of such innovations never make it past the proof-of-concept stage into full-scale operations.\n\n\nGaining strategic autonomy\nThe key towards creating sustainable change with digital technologies lies in increasing your own data literacy and understanding of AI, and that of your organisation. AI is not sci-fi, we need to demystify digital technologies. That way, professionals and domain experts can obtain strategic autonomy to reason, think, imagine and create applications with AI themselves. Technology can only be of value when it is put within the appropriate business, societal or human context.\nWe offer the following services to help you master data and AI yourself."
