I’m skilled in R, SQL, and spreadsheets. I enjoy tinkering with visualizations and always aim to tell a data-driven story.\n\n\nMy projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy academicresearch \n\n\n\nI solve problems\nLife and professional challenges often have diverse solutions, and I enjoy finding optimal ones. My PhD trained me in rigorous data analysis and research methodologies enabling me to tackle challenges systematically and with creativity.\n\n\n\n\n\nI break out (of my expertise bubble)\nMy scholarly work provided empirical evidence for a long-standing postulate. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, my work led to the development of a cost-effective measurement system prototype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m inspired by innovative ideas\nWhile in publishing, I identified a gap and opportunity for an innovative product within my company. I dedicated my off-work time to designing a visual prototype. After conceptualizing product vision, the prototype received positive feedback from my colleagues in a dedicated product team.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m collaborative.\nBelieving in the power of teamwork, I enjoy cross-functional collaboration, valuing insights from every team member - no important decisions should be made in a silo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI extend support\nMy publishing journey was all about supporting researchers in amplifying their work - to disseminate knowledge and break publishing paywalls at scale. I strategically developed content for three scholarly journals and fostered numerous relationships with researchers worldwide, both early-career and senior.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m upskilling.\nCurrently pursuing analytics-related certifications but I also enjoy exploring non-data topics, e.g. related to parenting, productivity, and science. I’m utilizing my ‘second brain’ built in Notion, which aims to optimize my life and work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Yet, the majority of organisations struggle to capture real value from data and AI-driven innovations. Studies have shown that up to 95% of such innovations never make it past the proof-of-concept stage into full-scale operations.\n\n\nGaining strategic autonomy\nThe key towards creating sustainable change with digital technologies lies in increasing your own data literacy and understanding of AI, and that of your organisation. AI is not sci-fi, we need to demystify digital technologies. That way, professionals and domain experts can obtain strategic autonomy to reason, think, imagine and create applications with AI themselves. Technology can only be of value when it is put within the appropriate business, societal or human context.\nWe offer the following services to help you master data and AI yourself."
