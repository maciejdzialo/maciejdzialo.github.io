Experienced in research methodologies I know how to approach challenges systematically and with a creative mindset.\n\n\n\n\n\nI break out (of my expertise bubble)\nHaving experience in interdisciplinary projects, I like to push myself out of my comfort zone.

Outside of my work, I conceptualized a vision and developed a visual prototype to address this gap. After presentation to my colleagues, the prototype garnered positive feedback and progressed into further development by the product team.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m collaborative.\nBelieving in the power of teamwork, I thrive on cross-functional collaboration, appreciating feedback from every team member. I simply believe that important decisions should never be made in a silo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI extend support\nThroughout my publishing journey, my focus has been on empowering researchers to amplify their work, disseminate knowledge, and break down publishing barriers at a scale. I strategically developed content for three scholarly journals and built numerous relationships with researchers worldwide, spanning from early-career to senior professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m upskilling\nPractice serves as my primary way of learning - a pathway to mastery. In my spare time, I dive into analytical projects, not only to broaden my skill set but also to refine my craft. I’m also enthusiastic about exploring a range of topics beyond data analysis, including parenting, productivity, and science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
