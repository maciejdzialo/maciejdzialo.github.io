    "text": "Thanks for popping into my little corner of the internet!I’m a data analyst with a scientific background, and I love diving into data to uncover valuable insights. For over eight years, I collaborated on international research projects, and I’ve dedicated two years to the world of open-access scholarly publishing.

I’m skilled in R, SQL, and spreadsheets, and I enjoy tinkering with visualizations - to craft a narrative driven by data insights.\n\n\nMy projects \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy academicresearch \n\n\n\nI solve problems\nLife and professional challenges often have diverse solutions, and I’m striving to find optimal ones. Experienced in research methodologies I approach challenges systematically and with a creative mindset.\n\n\n\n\n\nI break out (of my expertise bubble)\nHaving experience in interdisciplinary projects, I do not fear venturing beyond my expertise comfort zone. Through collaboration, I’ve developed a cost-effective measurement system prototype, also providing empirical evidence for a long-standing hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m inspired by innovative ideas\nWorking as a publishing specialist, I recognized an opportunity for innovation within my company. Outside of my work, I conceptualized a vision and developed a visual prototype to address this gap. Presenting it to my colleagues on the product team, the prototype garnered positive feedback and progressed into further development.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m collaborative.\nBelieving in the power of teamwork, I thrive on cross-functional collaboration, appreciating insights from every team member. I firmly believe that important decisions should never be made in a silo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI extend support\nThroughout my publishing journey, my focus has been on empowering researchers to amplify their work, disseminate knowledge, and break down publishing barriers at a scale. I strategically developed content for three scholarly journals and built numerous relationships with researchers worldwide, spanning from early-career to senior professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m upskilling\nPractice serves as my primary way of learning, a pathway to mastery. In my spare time, I dive into analytical projects, not only to broaden my skill set but also to refine my craft. I’m passionate about exploring a range of topics beyond data analysis, including parenting, productivity, and science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
