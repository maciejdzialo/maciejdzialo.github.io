# Hello there!

Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet. My name is Maciej Działo and I am a scientific-oriented professional capable of leveraging data analysis for actionable insights. I collaborated on international research projects for eight years and two years in open-access scholarly publishing. My vision is to empower businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions.

\
🔧 I solve problems - a skill I enjoyed during my PhD journey. You can explore some of my scientific contributions here: https://lnkd.in/dzj88i7i\
📈 I can wrangle data and provide insights - I am skilled in tidying data and leveraging it for statistical analyses, all in R.\
🌎 I extend support and reach out - I've built relationships with researchers worldwide to amplify their research at scale.\
💡 I know how to break out of my expertise bubble - I developed and constructed a prototype system that measures our cellular powerhouses 10x cheaper than a commonly used gold-standard system.\
🧠 I’m a little obsessed with innovative ideas - I designed a visual prototype and described a vision for a new social-driven platform - to accelerate open science and break knowledge paywalls.\
📖 I’m constantly learning and upskilling - to stay ahead, save time, and provide better insights.\
❇️ I’m collaborative - let’s discover together!
